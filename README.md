NOTE: this program uses an Arduino Mega, 4-digit seven segment display, and button.
This program lets you spin a slot machine type roll using a 4-digit seven segment display and a button. Each digit will spin at a different interval, so push the button to stop it one at a time. Once you stop all the digits, it will display a message on the serial monitor to show if you won, as well as light up the LED based on it. Press the button again to roll again.
